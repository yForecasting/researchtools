Recent research has addressed the integration of forecasting inside a DBMS. One main benefit is that models can be created once and then repeatedly used to answer forecast queries. Often forecast queries are submitted on higher aggregation levels, e.g., forecasts of sales over all locations. To answer such a forecast query, we have two possibilities. First, we can aggregate all base time series (sales in Austria, sales in Belgium ...) and create only one model for the aggregate time series. Second, we can create models for all base time series and aggregate the base forecast values. The second possibility might lead to a higher accuracy but it is usually too expensive due to a high number of base time series. However, we actually do not need all base models to achieve a high accuracy, a sample of base models is enough. With this approach, we still achieve a better accuracy than an aggregate model, very similar to using all models, but we need less models to create and maintain in the database. We further improve this approach if new actual values of the base time series arrive at different points in time. With each new actual value we can refine the aggregate forecast and eventually converge towards the real actual value. Our experimental evaluation using several real-world data sets, shows a high accuracy of our approaches and a fast convergence towards the optimal value with increasing sample sizes and increasing number of actual values respectively.

The challenge ahead for utility operators is to manage the operation and maintenance of a plant efficiently under the given circumstances. Therefore, the utility operators need to estimate the load so that there is no significant demand and supply mismatch. In the residential sector, the power consumption varies in every household, significantly depending upon the socio-demographical features, e.g., income, family size, age of resident etc. It is crucial to understand the relation of these socio-demographics on electricity consumption for its accurate forecasting. Besides, the smart meters in residential sector has made it possible for the household consumption to be known. A good estimation of load consumption at different levels is very important for efficient load management. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing a hierarchical structure by mining the electricity metered data to form customer clusters based on energy consumption patterns. To improve the forecasting performance, every cluster is associated with its distinct socio-demographical features. Based on the analytical results, it is evident that the hierarchical structure including socio-demographical features has the prospect to forecast load using a top-down approach, with an improvement in its mean absolute percent error by 9.04{\\\\%}, as compared to state-of-the-art bottom-up approaches. {\\\\copyright} 2022 IEEE.'), \n",

For example, inventory replenishment decisions require forecasts at the individual SKU level over lead time, whereas forecasts at higher levels, over longer horizons, are required for supply chain strategic decisions. The most accurate forecasts are not always obtained from data at the 'natural' level of aggregation. In some cases, forecast accuracy may be improved by aggregating data or forecasts at lower levels, or disaggregating data or forecasts at higher levels, or by combining forecasts at multiple levels of aggregation. Temporal and cross-sectional aggregation approaches are well established in the literature. More recently, it has been argued that these two approaches do not make the fullest use of data available at the different hierarchical levels of the supply chain. Therefore, consideration of forecasting hierarchies (over time and other dimensions), and combinations of forecasts across hierarchical levels, have been recommended.

Specifically, we examine the relative effectiveness of Top-Down (TD) and Bottom-Up (BU) strategies for forecasting the demand for a substitutable product (which belongs to a family) as well as the demand for the product family under different types of family demand processes. Through a simulation study, it is revealed that the TD strategy consistently outperforms the BU strategy for forecasting product family demand. The relative superiority of the TD strategy further improves by as much as 52{\\\\%} as the product demand variability increases and the degree of substitutability between the products decreases. This phenomenon, however, is not always true for forecasting the demand for the products within the family. In this case, it is found that there are a few situations wherein the BU strategy marginally outperforms the TD strategy, especially when the product demand variability is high and the degree of product substitutability is low. {\\\\copyright} 2008, Inderscience Publishers.'), \n",

While overcoming this difficulty, we reconsider the least squares minimization problem with non-negativity constraints to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative. The constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting (BPV) algorithm, projected conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms as the number of time series increases. The results demonstrate that the BPV algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and PCG is the second best. The superior performance of the BPV algorithm can be partially attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation over the unconstrained method. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level, slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision and policy implementation processes. {\\\\copyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.'), \n",

Since HF is a complicated procedure, analytical results are hard to obtain; consequently, most literature is based on simulations and case studies. This paper succeeds in following a more theoretical approach by simplifying the problem: we consider estimation instead of forecasting. So, from a random sample we estimate both the total demand and the fraction of this total that individual items take; multiplying these two quantities gives a new estimate of the individual demand. Then, our research question is: Can aggregation of items, followed by fractioning, lead to more accurate estimates of individual demand?

Over- or underestimating demand can result in loss of profits due to stock-outs or overstock. However, demand forecasting and production planning for perishable goods represent a significant challenge due to factors such as high volatility, significant variation, the dynamics of store-level product demand, and the need for L day ahead forecasting that allows enough time for production planning. By collaborating with a leading perishable product retailer, we have analyzed (1) detailed internal supply chain data, including sales transaction records and day-end inventories, along with (2) environmental factors, including temperature, weather conditions and wind speed. With the aim of minimizing loss of profit caused by inaccurate forecasting, we propose the following three-stage hierarchical demand forecasting model that leverages the combined data for perishable goods production planning: 1. Identification of store-level demand patterns, 2. store clustering for aggregated production, and 3. a recurrent dynamic network based on a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) for L-day ahead demand forecasting. Finally, we validate the proposed approach by comparing the loss of profits using this model with other baselines along with the industry standard model used in the perishable goods industry. Our proposed model successfully reduces lost profits to 3.30{\\\\%} of total sales, representing a reduction of 1.71{\\\\%} when compared with the industry standard production system. {\\\\copyright} 2019 IEEE.'), \n",

The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as ``coherence.'' Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et~al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to incoherence). We show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. We propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed-form solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.

In particular, we provide insights into the nature and mathematical derivation of the level-l conditional coherent (LlCC) point forecast reconciliation procedure for an elementary two-level hierarchy. We show that: (i) the LlCC procedure is the result of a linearly constrained minimization of a quadratic loss function, with an exogenous constraint given by the base forecast of the top level series of the hierarchy, which is not revised; and (ii) endogenous constraints may also be considered in the same framework, thereby resulting in level conditional reconciled forecasts where both the top and the bottom level time series forecasts are coherently revised. In addition, we show that the LlCC procedure (i.e., with exogenous constraints but the result also holds in the endogenous case) does not guarantee the non-negativity of the reconciled forecasts, which can be an issue in cases when non-negativity is a natural attribute of the variables that need to be forecast (e.g., sales and tourism flows). Finally, we consider two forecasting experiments to evaluate the performance of various cross-sectional forecast combination-based point forecast reconciliation procedures (vis-{\\\\`a}-vis the state-of-the-art procedures) in a fair setting. In this framework, due to the crucial role played by the (possibly different) models used to compute the base forecasts, we re-interpret the combined conditional coherent reconciliation procedure (CCCH) of Hollyman et al. (2021) as a forecast pooling approach, and show that accuracy improvements may be obtained by adopting a simple forecast averaging strategy. {\\\\copyright} 2022 International Institute of Forecasters'), \n",

The main reason of the observed improvements is due to the price and promotion information available at the retailer level, which is assumed to be unknown to the distributor. To reconcile forecasts according to the hierarchy, only the forecast values at retailer level are needed, the business strategies of individual retailers remain proprietary. A freely available dataset is considered to encourage further exploration. Data exploratory analysis and visualization tools are discussed in Part I of the paper. {\\\\copyright} 2015 IEEE.'), \n",

In this context, a model is fit to the observed data points of the time series by estimating the model parameters. The computed parameters are then utilized to forecast future points in time. Existing approaches integrate forecasting into traditional relational query processing, where a forecast query requests the creation of a forecast model. Models of continued interest should be deployed only once and used many times afterwards. This however leads to additional maintenance costs as models need to be kept up-to-date. Costs can be reduced by choosing a well-defined subset of models and answering queries using derivation schemes. In contrast to materialized view selection, model selection opens a whole new problem area as results are approximate. A derivation schema might increase or decrease the accuracy of a forecast query. Thus, a two-dimensional optimization problem of minimizing the model cost and model usage error is introduced in this paper. Our solution consists of a greedy enumeration approach that empirically evaluates different configurations of forecast models. In our experimental evaluation, with data sets from different domains, we show the superiority of our approach over traditional approaches from forecasting literature. {\\\\copyright} 2011 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

            "    ('abstract', 'Life expectancy has been increasing sharply around the globe since the second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970--2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated. {\\\\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

Moreover, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of mean squared errors (MSEs) of the two approaches. We show that the condition for the equality of MSEs holds even when the moving average parameters of the individual components are not identical. In addition, we show that the relative forecasting accuracy of TD and BU depends on the parametric structure of the underlying framework. Simulation results confirm our theoretical findings. Indeed, the ranking of TD and BU forecasts is led by the parametric structure of the underlying data generation process, regardless of possible misspecification issues. {\\\\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et~al. in 2011 to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels. They also enjoy improved forecast accuracy averaged over different disaggregation factors.

This article provides a comprehensive survey of computational intelligence techniques for wind power uncertainty quantification in smart grids. First, prediction intervals (PIs) are introduced as a means to quantify the uncertainties in wind power forecasts. Various PI evaluation indices, including the latest trends in comprehensive evaluation techniques, are compared. Furthermore, computational intelligence-based PI construction methods are summarized and classified into traditional methods (parametric) and direct PI construction methods (nonparametric). In the second part of this article, methods of incorporating wind power forecast uncertainties into power system decision-making processes are investigated. Three techniques, namely, stochastic models, fuzzy logic models, and robust optimization, and different power system applications using these techniques are reviewed. Finally, future research directions, such as spatiotemporal and hierarchical forecasting, deep learning-based methods, and integration of predictive uncertainty estimates into the decision-making process, are discussed.

This study introduces and evaluates the benefits of utilizing temporal hierarchical reconciliation methods for water resources forecasting, with an application to precipitation. Original (precipitation) Forecasts (ORFs) were produced using ``automatic'' Exponential Time-Series Smoothing (ETS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models at six timescales, namely, monthly, 2-monthly, quarterly, 4-monthly, bi-annual, and annual, for 84 basins extracted from the Canadian model parameter experiment. Temporal hierarchical reconciliation methods, including structural scaling-based Weighted Least Squares (WLS), series variance scaling-based WLS, and Ordinary Least Squares, along with the simple Bottom-Up (BU) method, were applied to reconcile the forecasts. In general, ETS (direct forecasting) demonstrated better performance compared to ANN and SARIMA (recursive forecasting). The results confirmed that improvements in accuracy due to reconciliation is dependent on the basin, timescale, and the ORFs' accuracy. For different forecast models, the reconciliation methods showed different levels of performance. For ETS, BU was able to improve forecast accuracy to a greater extent than the temporal hierarchical reconciliation methods, while for ANN and SARIMA, forecast accuracy was improved through all temporal hierarchical reconciliation methods but not BU. The reconciled forecasts' accuracy was affected more by the ORFs' accuracy than by the reconciliation method. Different timescales showed dissimilar sensitivity to reconciliation. The presented results are anticipated to serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating future developments in the promising area of temporal hierarchical reconciliation for water resources forecasting. {\\\\copyright} 2022.

This allows to accommodate overlooked uncertainties in forecast reconciliation. We show analytically that there are two potential sources of uncertainty in forecast reconciliation. We use simulated data to demonstrate how these uncertainties propagate to the covariance matrix estimation, introducing uncertainty in the reconciliation weights matrix. This then increases the uncertainty of the reconciled forecasts. We apply our understanding to modelling accident and emergency admissions in a UK hospital.

We conduct experiments to explore the robustness of the global bottom-up approach, and make comments on the efforts made by the top-ranking teams to improve the core approach.

Furthermore, forecasts of heat load are needed for optimized control of the district heating network since a lower temperature reduces the heat loss, but the required heat supply at the end-users puts a lower limit on the temperature level. Consequently, improving the accuracy of heat load forecasts leads to savings and reduced heat loss by enabling improved control of the network and an optimized production schedule at the plant. This paper proposes the use of temporal hierarchies to enhance the accuracy of heat load forecasts in district heating. Usually, forecasts are only made at the temporal aggregation level that is the most important for the system. However, forecasts for multiple aggregation levels can be reconciled and lead to more accurate forecasts at essentially all aggregation levels. Here it is important that the auto- and cross-covariance between forecast errors at the different aggregation levels are taken into account. This paper suggests a novel framework using temporal hierarchies and adaptive estimation to improve heat load forecast accuracy by optimally combining forecasts from multiple aggregation levels using a reconciliation process. The weights for the reconciliation are computed using an adaptively estimated covariance matrix with a full structure, enabling the process to share time-varying information both within and between aggregation levels. The case study shows that the proposed framework improves the heat load forecast accuracy by 15{\\\\%} compared to commercial state-of-the-art operational forecasts. {\\\\copyright} 2021 The Authors'), \n",

The family-based approach, sometimes referred to as hierarchical forecasting (HF), is based on a strategy of aggregating items into families. HF systems are capable of providing forecasts for items and their respective families. The objectives of HF systems, include improved forecast performance and a reduction in the overall forecasting burden. To date, several studies have offered practical guidelines for the structural design of HF systems. The primary purpose of this paper is to summarize these guidelines. First, an explanation of the HF process is provided. In this explanation, important system parameters and strategic choices, which allow for the custom configuration of HF systems are identified. Second, the relevant family-based forecast research is reviewed. The important issues addressed and the conclusions presented in this research are identified. Third, practical guidelines regarding the use of a HF approach that have been reported in the research literature are clearly delineated. With much still unknown regarding the performance impact of various system parameter and strategic process choices, the paper concludes with suggestions for future research. {\\\\copyright} 2001, MCB UP Limited'), \n",

For this reason, manufacturing companies consider forecasting a crucial process for effectively guiding several activities and research has devoted particular attention to this issue. This paper investigates the impact of how forecasting is conducted on forecast accuracy and operational performances (i.e. cost and delivery performances). Attention is here paid on three factors that characterize the forecasting process: whether structured techniques are adopted, whether information from different sources is collected to elaborate forecasts, and the extent to which forecasting is used to support decision-making processes. Analyses are conducted by means of data provided by the fourth edition of the Global Manufacturing Research Group survey. Data was collected from 343 companies belonging to several manufacturing industries from six different countries. Results show that companies adopting a structured forecasting process can improve their operational performances not simply because forecast accuracy increases. This paper highlights the importance of a proper forecasting-process design, that should be coherent with how users intend to exploit forecast results and with the aim that should be achieved, that is not necessarily improving forecast accuracy. {\\\\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

            "    5 years, studies on hierarchical forecasting have moved away from single-level approaches towards proposing linear combination approaches across multiple levels of the hierarchy. Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved post-sample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns. {\\\\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.'), ('year', '2021'), \n",

            "    ('abstract', 'Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications.

It can be formalized as a hierarchical time series forecasting problem with the aggregation constraints according to the geographical hierarchy, since the sum of the prediction results of the disaggregated time series should be equal to the prediction results of the aggregated ones. However in most previous work, the aggregation consistency is ensured at the loss of forecast accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based hierarchical electricity time series forecasting approach. Instead of dealing with the geographical hierarchy directly, we explore electricity consumption patterns by clustering analysis and build a new consumption pattern based time series hierarchy. We then present a novel hierarchical forecasting method with consumption hierarchical aggregation constraints to improve the electricity demand predictions of the bottom level, followed by a ``bottom-up'' method to obtain forecasts of the geographical higher levels. Especially, we observe that in our consumption pattern based hierarchy the reconciliation error of the bottom level time series is ``correlated'' to its membership degree of the corresponding cluster (consumption pattern), and hence apply this correlations as the regularization term in our forecasting objective function. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets verify that our approach achieves the best prediction accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. {\\\\copyright} 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

However, practical experience shows that forecasts of aggregate demand are quite accurate. Exact data for individual products can be determined for the current but not for the remaining periods. For the remaining periods only upper and lower bounds of the demand data for individual products can be predicted with certainty in many cases. This means that production planning should follow a hierarchical planning concept: First, production planning should be conducted at the aggregate level over the planning horizon to determine simultaneously the resource requirements (regular capacity and overtime) and the quantities of the product groups in order to satisfy aggregate demand. Second, for the immediate scheduling period the detailed planning level should determine how available production resources have to be allocated to the individual products subject to some constraints imposed by the aggregate plan. MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning) is a production planning system which is based on a hierarchical concept and has been developed for such complex production situations. The paper concludes that the MRP II concept is only partially suited to production planning in the case of uncertain demand. A hierarchical model, which can be incorporated into the MRP II concept, is therefore proposed for uncertain demand.

The demand for each stock keeping unit (SKU) at each store on each day needs to be determined to develop an effective and efficient inventory and logistics system for the retailer. The SKU-store-day demand is highly intermittent. In order to solve this challenging intermittent demand forecasting problem, we propose a greedy aggregation--decomposition method. It involves a new hierarchical forecasting structure and utilizes both aggregate and disaggregate forecasts, which differs from the classical bottom-up and top-down approach. The method is investigated on the real-world SKU-store-day demand database from this retailer in Singapore, and significantly outperforms other widely used intermittent demand forecasting methods. The proposed method also serves as a general self-improvement procedure for any intermittent time series forecasting method taking dual source of variations into account. Moreover, we introduce a revised mean absolute scaled error (RMASE) as a new accuracy measure for intermittent demand forecasting. It is a relative error measure, scale-independent, and compares with the error of zero forecasts. {\\\\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

The unavailability of statistical models for Zimbabwe international tourist arrivals that cater for disaggregated tourism data and account for uncertainty due to parameter estimation methods, has resulted in poor marketing strategies, infrastructure and policies targeting wrong tourism groups. Furthermore, the country is failing to attract significant Foreign Direct Investment for particular tourist arrivals. Zimbabwe's monthly international tourist arrivals data from January 2002 to December 2018 was used. The data set was disaggregated according to the purpose of the visit. Three hierarchical forecasting approaches, namely top-down, bottom-up and optimal combination approaches were applied to the data. The results showed the superiority of the bottom-up approach over both the top-down and optimal combination approaches. Forecasts indicate a general increase in aggregate series. The combined methods provide a new insight into modelling tourist arrivals. The approach is useful to the government, tourism stakeholders, and investors among others, for decision-making, resource mobilisation and allocation. The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) could adopt the forecasting techniques to produce informative and precise tourism forecasts. The data set used is before the COVID-19 pandemic and the models indicate what could happen outside the pandemic. During the pandemic the country was under lockdown with no tourist arrivals to report on. The models are useful for planning purposes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., `self-similarity'. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., `cross-similarity'. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths.

A deep learning method, the long-short-term-memory network, is used as the base forecasting method in the CTFF. The performance of the CTFF is evaluated on point-of-sales data from a large multi-channel retail supply chain. Through several performance metrics and statistical tests, we conclude that forecasts from the CTFF are significantly better than the direct forecasts. In addition, improvements are significant and consistent across cross-sectional and temporal levels of a supply chain. Further, it has been observed that bottom-up forecasts are more accurate than top-down forecasts when point-of-sales data is used for forecasting in online and offline retail supply chain. {\\\\copyright} 2020'), \n",

In the first phase, by LSTM-RNN, the proposed method makes predictions of the dependent variable given different candidate decompositions. Meanwhile, we devise a method creative use of Genetic algorithm to search for the top-performing decompositions of the dependent variable.

The first is a feature engineering approach whereby deterministic power forecasts from the turbine level are used as explanatory variables in a wind farm level forecasting model. The second is a novel bottom-up hierarchical approach where the wind farm forecast is inferred from the joint predictive distribution of the power output from individual turbines. Notably, the latter produces probabilistic forecasts that are coherent across both turbine and farm levels, which the former does not. The methods are tested at two utility scale wind farms and are shown to provide consistent improvements of up to 5{\\\\%}, in terms of continuous ranked probability score compared to the best performing state-of-the-art benchmark model. The bottom-up hierarchical approach provides greater improvement at the site characterized by a complex layout and terrain, while both approaches perform similarly at the second location.

With the improvement of living standards of residents, the total load of residential buildings increases, while the proportion of energy consumption of household appliances increases. Therefore, accurate prediction of household appliances energy consumption is of great significance for accurate prediction of residential load. The factors affecting the energy consumption mode of household appliances are complex, which are closely related to the user's use habits and their own control principles. Based on the electrical data obtained from power load monitoring, this paper presents a method of electrical energy consumption pattern analysis based on hierarchical clustering analysis and a method of home load forecasting based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Through the analysis method of electrical energy consumption mode, we can get the power consumption mode of different electrical appliances and the correlation degree between different electrical appliances. Then we can get the power consumption mode of a single family through the Monte Carlo-based household load forecasting method. Finally, different types of households are aggregated to the ground by bottom-up method to finish area load forecasting. {\\\\copyright} 2020 ACM.\"), \n",

            "    ('abstract', 'To integrate solar energy into the electricity grid reliably and efficiently, different forecasting techniques are used to produce forecasts at various forecast horizons using data of different levels of aggregation. For example, power generated by distributed photovoltaics (PV) can be disaggregated in a geographical hierarchy into transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters; forecasts are required at all of these levels to facilitate different power system operations and power plant management. Due to the different information sets visible to different players in the hierarchy, such as PV plant owners and independent system operators, the forecasts produced at different aggregation levels are often not optimal. Furthermore, these forecasts are aggregate inconsistent, i.e., forecasts made using data collected at lower levels do not add up exactly to the forecasts made using higher level data. In this paper, the state-of-the-art forecast reconciliation techniques are explored. By minimizing the trace of forecast error covariance matrix, the base forecasts obtained across the hierarchy can be optimally reconciled. The reconciled forecasts not only aggregate consistently, and thus lead to collaborative decision making, but also improve the base forecasts at each level significantly. The merit of the reconciliation framework goes to the fact that it does not require any additional information other than those base forecasts. Furthermore, forecast improvements are independent of the base forecasting methods. In other words, once the base forecasts are generated with our favorite methods, the reconciliation will most likely improve those forecasts further. The reconciliation techniques can be applied to a variety of hierarchies with different forecast horizons. The empirical part of this work considers two examples, namely, an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation over 318 simulated PV plants in the state of California, and a spatio-temporal statistical 1-min-ahead forecast reconciliation over 17 irradiance sensors on the Oahu Island, Hawaii. It is shown that reconciliation benefits both the gird operators and PV system owners by bringing more accurate forecasts, and thus motivates information sharing in an electricity grid. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd'), \n",

This is particularly common in forecasting where some variables are aggregates of others, commonly referred to as hierarchical time series, but also arises in other prediction settings. For point forecasting, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby forecasts are made for all series (so-called base forecasts) and subsequently adjusted to cohere with the constraints. We extend reconciliation from point forecasting to probabilistic forecasting. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic forecast. In the elliptical case, we prove that true predictive distributions can be recovered using reconciliation even when the location and scale of base predictions are chosen arbitrarily. Reconciliation weights are estimated to optimise energy or variogram score. The log score is not considered since it is improper when comparing unreconciled to reconciled forecasts, a result also proved in this paper. Due to randomness in the objective function, optimisation uses stochastic gradient descent. This method improves upon base forecasts in simulated and empirical data, particularly when the base forecasting models are severely misspecified. For milder misspecification, extending popular reconciliation methods for point forecasting results in similar performance to score optimisation. {\\\\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

            "    ('abstract', 'Time series forecasting plays an important role in many decision support systems, also in those related to the management of supply chains. Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy. The solutions produce optimal reconciled forecasts for each individual forecast horizon, but the link along time that is implied by the dynamics of the models is completely ignored. Therefore, the novel approach in this paper improves upon past research at least in two key points. Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something missing in past developments. The approach is assessed by comparing its forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer. {\\\\copyright} 2018'), \n",

It enables better decision making in the planning of service part procurement and distribution. To achieve high responsiveness, the service supply chain network exhibits a hierarchical structure: forward stocking locations (FSL) close to the end customer, distribution centers (DC) in the middle and center hub (CH) at the top. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the service supply chain network, but also the consistency between different levels. The accuracy and consistency of hierarchical forecasts are important to be interpretable to the decision-makers (DM). Moreover, service part demand data is the spatial-temporal time series that the observations made at neighboring regions and adjacent timestamps are not independent but dynamically correlated with each other. Recent advances in deep learning enable promising results in modeling the complex spatial-temporal relationship. Researchers use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to model spatial correlations and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model temporal correlations. However, these deep learning models are non-transparent to the DMs who broadly require justifications in the decision-making processes. Here an interpretable solution is in the urgent demand. In this paper, we present an interpretable general framework STAH (Spatial-Temporal Attention Graph Convolution network for Hierarchical demand forecast).

In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

            "    ('abstract', 'In this paper, we propose a new framework to coherently produce probabilistic mortality forecasts by exploiting techniques in seasonal time-series models, extreme value theory (EVT), and hierarchical forecast reconciliation. In a hierarchical setting, coherent forecasts are those forecasts that add up in a manner consistent with the aggregation structure of the collection of time series. We are amongst the first to model and analyze U.S. monthly death data during the period from 1968--2019 to explore the seasonality and the age--gender dependence structure of mortality. Our results indicate that incorporating EVT and hierarchical forecast reconciliation greatly improves the overall forecast accuracy, which has important implications for life insurers in terms of rate making, reserve setting, and capital adequacy compliance. Using the solvency capital requirement (SCR) under Solvency II as an example, we show that the SCR calculated by our approach is considerably higher than those calculated by alternative models, suggesting that failing to account for extreme mortality risk and mortality dependence in the hierarchy can result in significantly underfunded problems for life insurers. We also find that our model can yield death forecasts that are largely consistent with actual observations in most of months in 2021 when death tolls surged due to COVID-19. This provides additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model for practical uses. {\\\\copyright} 2022 International Institute of Forecasters'), \n",

It is challenging to identify an ML model that has the outperformance in all scenarios. Therefore, there are a number of aggregation strategies developed to improve STLF. However, the superiority of these aggregation strategies has not been assessed. In this paper, STLF with three aggregation strategies are developed, which are information aggregation (IA), model aggregation (MA), and hierarchy aggregation (HA). The IA, MA, and HA strategies aggregate inputs, models, and forecasts at the pre-forecasting, model-building, or post-forecasting stage, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the three aggregation strategies, a set of 10 models based on 4 machine-learning algorithms are developed in each aggregation category to predict 1-hour-ahead load. Case studies show that: (i) STLF-IA presents superior performance than STLF with weather data and STLF with individual load data consistently, and the performance can be further enhanced by the recursive feature elemination (RFE) feature selection method; (ii) MA improves the STLF robustness by reducing the risk of unsatisfactory single-algorithm STLF models; and (iii) STLF-HA produces the most accurate forecasts with a 0.83{\\\\%} normalized mean absolute error and a 1.35{\\\\%} mean absolute percentage error, while keeping hierarchical aggregate consistency. {\\\\copyright} 2020'), \n",

Time series data used in these areas is often hierarchically organized and thus, aggregated along the hierarchy levels based on their dimensional features. Calculating forecasts in these environments is very time consuming, due to ensuring forecasting consistency between hierarchy levels. To increase the forecasting efficiency for hierarchically organized time series, we introduce a novel forecasting approach that takes advantage of the hierarchical organization. There, we reuse the forecast models maintained on the lowest level of the hierarchy to almost instantly create already estimated forecast models on higher hierarchical levels. In addition, we define a hierarchical communication framework, increasing the communication flexibility and efficiency.

In today's dynamic environment, it is especially relevant to consider a combination of both approaches. However, the question remains as to how this combination should occur. This study compares two different ways of combining statistical and judgmental forecasting, employing real-life data from an international publishing company that produces weekly forecasts on regular and exceptional products. Two forecasting methodologies that are able to include human judgment are compared. In a 'restrictive judgement' model, expert predictions are incorporated as restrictions on the forecasting model. In an 'integrative judgment' model, this information is taken into account as a predictive variable in the demand forecasting process. The proposed models are compared on error metrics and analysed with regard to the properties of the adjustments (direction, size) and of the forecast itself (volatility, periodicity). The integrative approach has a positive effect on accuracy in all scenarios. However, in those cases where the restrictive approach proved to be beneficial, the integrative approach limited these beneficial effects. The study links with demand planning by using the forecasts as input for an optimization model to determine the ideal number of SKUs per Point of Sale (PoS), making a distinction between SKU forecasts and SKU per PoS forecasts. Importantly, this enables performance to be expressed as a measure of profitability, which proves to be higher for the integrative approach than for the restrictive approach. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.\"), \n",

We provide an alternative to the traditional discussion of bottom-up versus top-down forecasting by examining how the hierarchy of products can be exploited when forecasts are generated. Instead of selecting series from parts of the hierarchy for forecasting, we explore the possibility of using all the series. Moreover, instead of using the hierarchy after the initial forecasts are generated, we consider the hierarchical structure as a defining feature of the data-generating process and use it to instantaneously generate forecasts for all levels of the hierarchy. This integrated approach uses a state space model and the Kalman filter to explicitly incorporate product dependencies, such as complementarity of products and product substitution, which are otherwise ignored. An empirical study shows the substantial gain in forecast and inventory performance of generalizing the bottom-up and top-down forecast approaches to an integrated approach. The integrated approach is applicable to hierarchical forecasting in general, and extends beyond the current application of demand forecasting for manufacturers. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

Further, power forecast for a single wind farm leads to considerable forecast error due to the stochastic nature of wind and associated nonlinearity of turbines' power curves. This error can be drastically decreased with the help of aggregated power forecasting of wind farms in a large region utilizing spatial smoothing effects. Forecasting through the hierarchical aggregation of wind farms allows forecasts at different levels of power system networks. Hierarchical aggregated forecasting is widely implemented using either top-down or bottom-up approaches. However, these methods use wind power data patterns using a single level to get the forecasts of the entire hierarchy and thus result in lower prediction accuracy. In this context, the present work proposes combinations of top-down and bottom-up methods using a hierarchical time series framework. Several combinations of top-down and bottom-up forecast approaches are tested and results show that the Variance-Covariance method provides the best results in terms of prediction accuracy. {\\\\copyright} 2022 IEEE.\"), \n",

Aside from its clear presentational and operational virtues, the reconciliation approach generally improves the accuracy of the combined forecasts. In this paper, we examine the mechanisms by which this improvement is generated by re-formulating the reconciliation problem as a combination of direct forecasts of each time series with additional indirect forecasts derived from the linear constraints. Our work establishes a direct link between the nascent Forecast Reconciliation literature and the extensive work on Forecast Combination. In the original hierarchical setting, our approach clarifies for the first time how unbiased forecasts for the entire collection can be generated from base forecasts made at any level of the hierarchy, and we illustrate more generally how simple robust combined forecasts can be generated in any multivariate setting subject to linear constraints. In an empirical example, we show that simple combinations of such forecasts generate significant improvements in forecast accuracy where it matters most: where noise levels are highest and the forecasting task is at its most challenging. {\\\\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

Second, for each series, the aggregation algorithm ML-Poly, introduced by Gaillard, Stoltz, and van Erven in 2014, finds an optimal linear combination of the benchmarks. Finally, the forecasts are projected onto a coherent subspace to ensure that the final forecasts satisfy the hierarchical constraints. By minimizing a regret criterion, we show that the aggregation and projection steps improve the root mean square error of the forecasts.

However, it is particularly challenging to forecast these hierarchical structures. In fact, it requires not only good forecast accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between dierent levels, i.e. the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Given some incoherent base forecasts, the state-of-the-art methods compute revised forecasts based on forecast combination which ensures that the aggregation constraints are satised. However, these methods assume the base forecasts are unbiased and constrain the revised forecasts to be also unbiased. We propose a new forecasting method which relaxes these unbiasedness conditions, and seeks the revised forecasts with the best tradeo between bias and forecast variance. We also present a regularization method which allows us to deal with high-dimensional hierarchies, and provide its theoretical justication. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods both theoretically and empirically.

In this work, we propose a novel pattern-based hierarchical time series forecasting (PHF) method which consists of two aggregation stages. In the first aggregation stage, by exploring the electricity consuming patterns with clustering method, the bottom level electricity demand forecasting is improved, and in the second stage the region level aggregation is conducted to achieve the whole level forecasting. The experiments are conducted on the Energy Demand Research Project (EDRP) datasets, and the experimental results show that compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the prediction accuracy in all hierarchical levels with keeping aggregation consistency.

            "    ('abstract', 'Demand forecasting is a major issue in several industrial sectors. A relevant choice for companies is the proper level of forecast aggregation. Forecasters need to properly identify what is the object of the forecasting process, in terms of time bucket (e.g., forecasts are produced on a daily level or on weekly one), set of items the demand refers to (e.g., single item or group of items), set of locations the demand refers to (e.g., single store or chain of stores). Managers can follow two basic approaches: on the one hand they can adopt a detailed forecasting approach, i.e., they can forecast demand for the item at the store by simply looking at the demand for the specific item/store; on the other hand they can adopt an aggregated forecasting approach. In this paper, we aim at figuring out what is the balance between the strengths and weaknesses of these two options, and to identify the contingent variables that might lead managers to adopt one approach rather than the other. In this paper we study the aggregation across locations by evaluating the components of forecasting error under the assumption of stationary demand. Finally, we suggest metrics that one can adopt to support the choice of the appropriate forecasting process, thus providing help to managers in defining the proper level of aggregation for a specific situation. {\\\\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It allows for the joint reconciliation at all forecast horizons and uses predictive distributions rather than past variation of forecast errors. Informative priors are used to assign weights to specific predictions, which makes it possible to reconcile forecasts such that they accommodate specific judgmental predictions or managerial decisions. The reconciled forecasts adhere to hierarchical constraints, which facilitates communication and supports aligned decision-making at all levels of complex hierarchical structures. An extensive forecasting study is conducted on a large collection of 13,118 time series that measure Swiss merchandise exports, grouped hierarchically by export destination and product category. We find strong evidence that in addition to producing coherent forecasts, reconciliation also leads to substantial improvements in forecast accuracy.

It can be challenging to estimate the full cross-covariance matrix for a temporal hierarchy, which can easily be of very large dimension, yet it is difficult to know a priori which part of the error structure is most important. To address these issues, we propose to use eigendecomposition for dimensionality reduction when reconciling forecasts to extract as much information as possible from the error structure given the data available. We evaluate the proposed estimator in a simulation study and demonstrate its usefulness through applications to short-term electricity load and financial volatility forecasting. We find that accuracy can be improved uniformly across all aggregation levels, as the estimator achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being applicable to hierarchies of all sizes. {\\\\copyright} 2020 The Author(s)'), \n",

However, the proposed understanding of these characteristics is limited by the intrinsic complexity of the imports/exports. Since economic systems are naturally organized by hierarchies, a novel hierarchical model is proposed in this paper to forecast China's foreign trade. First, the foreign trade data are disaggregated from perspectives of trading partners and trading products, forming two independent hierarchical models with total exports and imports as target variables. Second, a bottom-up strategy is applied. All bottom time series are modelled by corresponding control variables according to trading theories. Forecasts for bottom time series are then combined to generate initial forecasts for total exports and imports. Finally, forecasts for total imports and exports from the two hierarchical models, plus a single VECM model are combined to generate final forecasts. Empirical experiments show that this proposed forecasting model approach significantly outperforms benchmark models and produces consistent forecasts for both total imports and exports or detailed items, which helps a lot for analyzing future trading structure evolution and making foreign trade policies. {\\\\copyright} 2020, The Editorial Office of JSSC {\\\\&} Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.\"), \n",

The data during 1968-2007 are treated as a training set whereas during 2008-17 as a test set. The means of female TIM of Punjab, Sind, KPK and Balochistan are 79678, 28448, 17531, and 8758.6 respectively while the means of male TIM of the same order are 98264, 33098, 23258, and 8832.5 respectively. The Standard Deviation (SD) of Punjab female TIM is maximum i.e., 12543 and KPK female TIM is 3073.6 while the SD of Punjab male TIM is Maximum i.e., 20396 and Balochistan male TIM is 2912.2 only. It indicates the strong genetic makeup and better immune system of females than males. It might be because of the population density also. TIM of Pakistan was predicted using Bottom-Up, Top-Down and Optimal Combination techniques taking ARIMA as the base. The goodness of fit was also tested using MPE, MAPE and RMSE. The smaller values of RMSE for female Punjab, male Sindh, male-female KPK and male-female Balochistan are 3905.38, 6377.55, 3453.44, 3088.42, 2026.49 and 2224.30 respectively illustrating that Optimal Combination technique fitted better than the Bottom-Up and Top-Down techniques. For comparison purposes, TIM was also forecasted during 2018-27 using the said three techniques.

The independent selection of weights for all the series at each level of the hierarchy makes the HA inconsistent while aggregating suitably across the hierarchy.

            "    ('abstract', 'A real world supply chain planning starts with the demand forecasting as a key input. In most scenarios, especially in fields like e-commerce where demand patterns are complex and are large scale, demand forecasting is done independent of supply chain constraints. There have been a plethora of methods, old and recent, for generating accurate forecasts. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the methods take supply chain constraints into account during forecasting. In this paper, we are primarily interested in supply chain aware forecasting methods that does not impose any restrictions on demand forecasting process. We assume that the base forecasts follow a distribution from exponential family and are provided as input to supply chain planning by specifying the distribution form and parameters. With this in mind, following are the contributions of our paper. First, we formulate the supply chain aware forecast improvement of a base forecast as finding the game theoretically optimal parameters satisfying the supply chain constraints. Second, for regular distributions from exponential family, we show that this translates to projecting base forecast onto the (convex) set defined by supply constraints, which is at least as accurate as the base forecasts. Third, we note that using off the shelf convex solvers does not scale for large instances of supply chain, which is typical in e-commerce settings. We propose algorithms that scale better with problem size. We propose a general gradient descent based approach that works across different distributions from exponential family. We also propose a network flow based exact algorithm for Laplace distribution (which relates to mean absolute error, which is the most commonly used metric in forecasting). Finally, we substantiate the theoretical results with extensive experiments on a real life e-commerce data set as well as a range of synthetic data sets. {\\\\copyright} 2022 ACM.'), \n",

In this research, the LCD monitor market is considered for an empirical study on hierarchical forecasting (HF). The proposed HF methodology consists of five steps. First, the three hierarchical levels of the LCD monitor market are identified. Second, several exogenously driven factors that significantly affect the demand for LCD monitors are identified at each level of product hierarchy. Third, the three forecasting techniques - regression analysis, transfer function, and simultaneous equations model - are combined to forecast future demand at each hierarchical level. Fourth, various forecasting approaches and disaggregating proportion methods are adopted to obtain consistent demand forecasts at each hierarchical level. Finally, the forecast errors with different forecasting approaches are assessed in order to determine the best forecasting level and the best forecasting approach. The findings show that the best forecast results can be obtained by using the middle-out forecasting approach.

            "    ('abstract', 'Most operations decisions are based on some kind of forecast of future demand. Thus, forecasting is definitely a very traditional area in the operations and inventory management literature. While literature concerning forecast explores the adoption of various qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper tries to design new solutions to improve forecasting accuracy by focusing on the forecasting process that uses such algorithms. In particular, when forecasting demand one should always make clear exactly what he/she is trying to forecast, in terms of the time bucket (i.e., the period of time over which demand is aggregated), the forecasting horizon, the set of items the demand refers to (e.g., forecasting demand for a single item can be much harder than forecasting demand for a group of items), the set of locations the demand refers to (e.g., demand at the single store level is much less predictable than the demand for a whole chain of stores). Traditionally, these features of the final output of forecasting also influence the forecasting process. Indeed, when one wants to forecast demand at single store single item single day level it seems natural to analyse demand and causal factors at the same level of aggregation. On the contrary, in this paper we aim at showing that; first of all often aggregating and/or disaggregating data in the forecasting process can lead to substantial improvements; second, the choice of the appropriate level of aggregation depends on the underlying demand generation process. In addition, most forecasting algorithms tend to focus on a single demand variable. On the contrary, we can analyse analogous time series to improve the effectiveness of the forecasting process. Clustering techniques can be used to identify such homologous time series. Such clusters of homologous time series can provide, on the one hand, the sample size required to gain good statistical confidence and, on the other hand, relatively homogeneous data. In the paper, we use sales data from a food retailer at a very detailed level to test our hypotheses.

This paper presents a new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts.

This paper extends the discussion into probability space, and studies how reconciliation can affect the performance of probabilistic forecasting. More specifically, qualities of the parametric predictive distributions before and after reconciliation are compared. Four minimum-trace-based reconciliation techniques are used to reconcile day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts generated using two datasets: (1) distributed solar power generation for 318 simulated PV systems in California, and (2) satellite-derived irradiance over Arizona. The empirical result shows that reconciliation not only improves the accuracy of point forecasts, but also leads to high-quality predictive distributions in terms of sharpness, calibration, and skill score. Moreover, such improvement is quite general, and does not seem to depend on data, hierarchy structure, nor the underlying forecasting model. {\\\\copyright} 2020 International Solar Energy Society'), \n",

HDP is based on the assumption of independence among variables, and this allows for simple and easy aggregation and separation of plans and data. However, the most commonly used arguments for grouping and subsequent aggregating is shared traits contrary to the assumption of independency. One of the predominant issues is the conflicting objectives on different decision levels. An example of this is found in hierarchical forecasting of demand. When forecasting on e.g. a product family level to establish capacity requirements, the objective is usually to achieve a Mean Error (ME) of zero. This conflicts with forecasting for Demand Planning (DP) purposes on SKU level, where minimization of the Standard Deviation of Error (SDE) might be more important. In this paper these issues are addressed through a simple example of hierarchical forecasting and use of a Goal Programming (GP) approach to satisfy both objectives.

When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting. {\\\\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd'), \n",

To ensure aligned decision-making across the hierarchy, it is essential that forecasts at the most disaggregated level add up to forecasts at the aggregate levels above. It is not clear if these aggregate forecasts should be generated independently or by using an hierarchical forecasting method that ensures coherent decision-making at the different levels but does not guarantee, at least, the same accuracy. To give guidelines on this issue, our empirical study investigates the relative performance of independent and reconciled forecasting approaches, using real data from a Portuguese retailer. We consider two alternative forecasting model families for generating the base forecasts; namely, state space models and ARIMA. Appropriate models from both families are chosen for each time-series by minimising the bias-corrected Akaike information criteria. The results show significant improvements in forecast accuracy, providing valuable information to support management decisions. It is clear that reconciled forecasts using the Minimum Trace Shrinkage estimator (MinT-Shrink) generally improve on the accuracy of the ARIMA base forecasts for all levels and for the complete hierarchy, across all forecast horizons. The accuracy gains generally increase with the horizon, varying between 1.7{\\\\%} and 3.7{\\\\%} for the complete hierarchy. It is also evident that the gains in forecast accuracy are more substantial at the higher levels of aggregation, which means that the information about the individual dynamics of the series, which was lost due to aggregation, is brought back again from the lower levels of aggregation to the higher levels by the reconciliation process, substantially improving the forecast accuracy over the base forecasts. {\\\\copyright} 2019 by the authors.'), \n",

However, the restrictive structure of this top-down approach implying that upper level decisions are the constraints for lower level decisions also has its shortcomings. One problem that occurs is that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences. Therefore, a planned utilisation factor has to be included into this deterministic aggregate planning problem. In practice, this decision is often based on past data and not consciously taken. In this paper, the effect of long-term forecast error on the optimal planned utilisation factor is evaluated for a production system facing stochastic demand and the benefit of exploiting this decisions potential is discussed. Overall costs including capacity, backorder and inventory costs, are determined with simulation for different multi-stage and multi-item production system structures. The results show that the planned utilisation factor used in the aggregate planning problem has a high influence on optimal costs. Additionally, the negative effect of forecast errors is evaluated and discussed in detail for different production system environments. {\\\\copyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\\\\&} Francis Group.'), \n",

Although hierarchical forecasting, such as the bottom-up, the top-down, and the optimal reconciliation methods, can address the aggregation consistency concerns, it does not resolve the model selection uncertainty. To address this issue, we rely on Multiple Temporal Aggregation (MTA), which has been shown to mitigate the model selection problem for low-frequency time series. We propose a modification of the Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm, a special implementation of MTA, for high-frequency time series to better handle the undesirable effect of seasonality shrinkage that MTA implies and combine it with conventional cross-sectional hierarchical forecasting. The impact of incorporating temporal aggregation in hierarchical forecasting is empirically assessed using a real data set from five bank branches.

Usually, hierarchical time series forecasting can be realized with a two-step method, in which all time series are forecasted independently and then the forecasting results are reconciled to satisfy aggregation consistency. However, these two-step methods have a high computational complexity and are unable to ensure optimal forecasts for all time series. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical forecasting approach to solve the above problems. Based on multi-task learning, we construct an integrated model that combines features of the bottom level series and the hierarchical structure. Then forecasts of all time series are output simultaneously and they are aggregated consistently. The model has the advantage of utilizing the correlation between time series. And the forecasting results are overall optimal by optimizing a global loss function. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality as the number of time series grows larger, we further learn a sparse model with group sparsity and element-wise sparsity constraints according to data characteristics.

            "    ('abstract', \"Previously in ``Reconciling solar forecasts: Geographical hierarchy'' [Solar Energy 146 (2017) 276--286], we have demonstrated that by reconciling the forecasts obtained from a geographical hierarchy (formed by levels such as transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters), more accurate forecasts can be obtained as compared to forecasts produced using only the information from a single level. Furthermore, these reconciled forecasts are aggregate consistent, facilitating different power system operations and power plant management. In this paper, we continue our discussion on hierarchical reconciliation and consider another type of hierarchy, namely, temporal hierarchy. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed by aggregating a high-frequency time series (e.g., \n",
            "    hourly) into different low-frequency time series (e.g., 6-hourly and daily). While the measurements in a temporal hierarchy sum up consistently (e.g., the first two points in an hourly time series sum up to be the first point in the 2-hourly time series), the forecasts in general do not sum up, due to the different models used to generate forecasts. This inconsistency poses an apparent problem when selecting forecasts. Using reconciliation could mitigate the problem by reconciling different forecasts obtained at different timescales, and thus generating aggregate consistent forecasts. In addition, the reconciled forecasts reduce modeling uncertainties using combinations -- similar to the ensemble forecasting used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) -- and thus improve forecast accuracy. The empirical part of the paper consists an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation example. Hourly data from 318 sites in California, over a period of \n",
            "    1 year, is used. Over 50 million forecasts are produced in this paper, in an operational forecasting context. Temporal reconciliation is shown to significantly outperform NWP forecasts produced by 3TIER, with a forecast skill (computed based on 3TIER forecasts) up to 0.3. Since reconciliation does not require any additional information, such improvement is thus encouraging. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd\"), ('year', '2017'), \n",

First, we address the problem of determining the system size by employing a hierarchical prediction framework that proactively provisions resources based on statistical models of the incoming workload. Second, we show how to employ the hierarchical prediction framework for designing a dispatching mechanism which can be used with any request distribution policy. Third, we propose two novel prediction-based locality-aware request distribution policies: Oblivious Locality-Aware Request Distribution (OLARD) and Affinity-Based Locality-Aware Request Distribution (ABLARD). We demonstrate the advantages of using our hierarchical prediction framework and how our approach achieves a high content locality, while adapting to unexpected workload changes. {\\\\copyright} 2012 IEEE.'), \n",

The idea of reconciliation of prediction on grouped time-series has been previously proposed to provide optimal forecasts based on such data. This method in effect, models the time-series collectively rather than providing a separate model for time-series at each level. While originally, the idea of reconciliation is applicable on data of time-series nature, it is not clear if such an approach can also be applicable to regression settings where multi-attribute data is available. In this paper, we address such a problem by proposing Reconciliation for Regression (R4R), a two-step approach for prediction and reconciliation. In order to evaluate this method, we test its applicability in the context of Travel Time Prediction (TTP) of bus trips where two levels of values need to be calculated: (i) travel times of the links between consecutive bus-stops; and (ii) total trip travel time. The results show that R4R can improve the overall results in terms of both link TTP performance and reconciliation between the sum of the link TTPs and the total trip travel time. We compare the results acquired when using group-based reconciliation methods and show that the proposed reconciliation approach in a regression setting can provide better results in some cases. This method can be generalized to other domains as well. {\\\\copyright} 2020, The Author(s).'), ('year', '2020'), \n",

Forecasting of hierarchical time series is a challenging and time-consuming problem owing to ensuring the forecasting consistency among the hierarchy levels based on their dimensional features. The excellent empirical performance of our Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM) approach on various forecasting tasks motivated us to extend it to solve the forecasting problem through hierarchical architectures. Toward this target, we develop the DLSTM model in auto-encoder (AE) fashion and take full advantage of the hierarchical architecture for better time series forecasting. DLSTM-AE works as an alternative approach to traditional and machine learning approaches that have been used to manipulate hierarchical forecasting. However, training a DLSTM in hierarchical architectures requires updating the weight vectors for each LSTM cell, which is time-consuming and requires a large amount of data through several dimensions. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by training first the time series at the bottom level of the hierarchy using the proposed DLSTM-AE approach. Then, we transfer the learned features to perform synchronous training for the time series of the upper levels of the hierarchy. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we compare its performance with existing approaches using two case studies related to the energy and tourism domains. An evaluation of all approaches was based on two criteria, namely, the forecasting accuracy and the ability to produce coherent forecasts through through the hierarchy. In both case studies, the proposed approach attained the highest accuracy results among all counterparts and produced more coherent forecasts. {\\\\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

We provide an extension of this decomposition for the multi-level case. An extensive analysis is also carried out answering the question of why the combination of predictions using information learned at different levels constitutes a significantly better approach in comparison to using only the predictions generated at one of the levels or other multi-level approaches. Additionally we argue why multi-level combinations should be used in addition to thick modelling and the use of different function spaces.

This paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach for hierarchical forecasting that directly handles missing values. First, we show that a class of off-the-shelf machine learning models already leads to coherent hierarchical forecasts. Next, we describe a conditional stochastic optimization approach based on prescriptive trees for end-to-end learning with missing values, that fully utilizes the available data. We validate the proposed approach in two case studies comprising 60 wind turbines and 20 photovoltaic parks, respectively.

In order to bridge the gap between forecasting and decision, a novel cost-oriented machine learning (COML) framework is established, which unifies nonparametric renewable power PI construction and decision-making. Formulated as a bilevel programming model, the COML minimizes the operational costs of decision-making process by adaptively adjusting the quantile proportion pair of PIs resulting from extreme learning machine based quantile regression. The hierarchical optimization model of the COML is equivalently simplified as a single level nonlinear programming problem. Then an enhanced branch-and-contract algorithm with innovative bounds contraction strategy is devised to efficiently capture the optimum of the single level problem with bilinear nonconvexity. Numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data simulate the online forecasting and decision process for wind power offering. Comprehensive comparisons verify the substantial superiority of the proposed COML methodology in terms of forecasting quality, operational value, as well as computational efficiency for practical application. {\\\\copyright} 1969-2012 IEEE.'), \n",

In this context, the long term electricity consumption projections of a country or region are highly relevant for decision-making of companies and organizations operating in any energy system. In this paper, it is proposed a methodology that combines the bottom-up approach with hierarchical linear models for long term electricity consumption forecasting of a particular industrial sector considering energy efficiency scenarios. In addition, the Bayesian inference is used for model parameter estimation and, enabling the inclusion of uncertainty in the forecasts produced by the model. The model was applied to the Brazilian pulp and paper industry and it was able to capture the trajectory of the real consumption observed during the 2008--2014 period.

Wherein the forecasts are generated using the ``horses-for-courses'' approach to achieve maximum accuracy at the base level. Generally, these base forecasts do not add up across temporal or cross-sectional hierarchies and give rise to the issue of forecast ``incoherence''. Accordingly, the present study extends the idea of utilising optimal forecast reconciliation techniques in CT forecasting. However, the frameworks of these techniques do not allow for their interaction across different dimensions of hierarchy present in CT data. Hence, the paper addresses this problem by proposing a cross-temporal forecast reconciliation framework. Further, monthly CT data from the Port of Los Angeles is used for empirical analysis. It is observed that the proposed framework, with exponential smoothing as the base forecasting method, can provide coherent forecasts at all levels and hierarchical dimensions while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the forecasts. Further, the study also devises a mechanism to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework in providing decision support for various port operations (the requirement for terminal ground slots and gantry cranes). The results indicate that improvements could be made in port operations decisions using the proposed framework. {\\\\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"), \n",

            "    ('abstract', 'Forecasting of solar PV generation plays an important role in power system operations. Forecasts are required on various geographical and temporal scales, which can be modeled as hierarchies. In a geographical hierarchy, the overall forecast for the region can either be obtained by directly forecasting the regional time series or by aggregating the individual forecasts generated for the sub-regions. This leads to a problem known as aggregate inconsistency as the two sets of forecasts are most likely different due to modeling uncertainties. Hence, practice is not optimal. Statistically optimal aggregation known as reconciliation, has been proven to provide aggregate consistent forecasts. Reconciliation helps system operators to have a superior foresight in a region-wise level, which eventually results in efficient system planning. The focus of this paper is on improving reconciliation accuracy. In addition, the effects of more accurate disaggregated and aggregated forecasts on the final reconciled predictions have been analyzed. A total of 318 simulated PV plants in California have been used to build a geographical hierarchy. More accurate NWP based and aggregated level forecasts are obtained with model output statistics and artificial neural network models. Significant improvements are observed in reconciled forecasts without using any exogenous information. {\\\\copyright} 2018 IEEE.'), \n",

Besides the usual set of explanatory attributes we may also have exact (or approximate) estimates of aggregated targets, which are the sums of disjoint sets of individual targets that we are trying to predict. Hence, the question now becomes can we use these aggregated targets, which are a coarser piece of information, to improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets? In this paper, we provide a simple yet provable way of accomplishing this. In particular, given predictions from any regression model of the target on the test data, we elucidate a provable method for improving these predictions in terms of mean squared error, given exact (or accurate enough) information of the aggregated targets. These estimates of the aggregated targets may be readily available or obtained - through multilevel regression - at different levels of granularity. Based on the proof of our method we suggest a criterion for choosing the appropriate level. Moreover, in addition to estimates of the aggregated targets, if we have exact (or approximate) estimates of the mean and variance of the target distribution, then based on our general strategy we provide an optimal way of incorporating this information so as to further improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets.

Many models produce independent forecasts for each geographical unit, ignoring the constraint that the national wILI is a weighted sum of regional wILI, where the weights correspond to the population size of the region. We propose a novel algorithm that transforms a set of independent forecast distributions to obey this constraint, which we refer to as probabilistically coherent.

We apply this approach to analyzing the Swiss Re Kortis bond, which is the first longevity trend bond introduced in the market. We express the longevity divergence index associated with the bond's principal reduction factor (PRF) in a hierarchical setting. We first adopt time-series models to obtain forecasts on each hierarchical level, and then apply a minimum trace reconciliation approach to ensure coherence of forecasts across all levels. Based on the reconciled probabilistic forecasts of the longevity divergence index, we estimate the probability distribution of the PRF of the Kortis bond, and compare our results with those stated in Standard and Poor's report on pre-sale information. We also illustrate the strong performance of the approach by comparing the reconciled forecasts with unreconciled forecasts as well as those from the bottom-up approach and the optimal combination approach.

            "    ('abstract', 'This paper discusses the prediction of hierarchical time series, where each upper-level time series is calculated by summing appropriate lower-level time series. Forecasts for such hierarchical time series should be coherent, meaning that the forecast for an upper-level time series equals the sum of forecasts for corresponding lower-level time series. Previous methods for making coherent forecasts consist of two phases: first computing base (incoherent) forecasts and then reconciling those forecasts based on their inherent hierarchical structure. To improve time series predictions, we propose a structured regularization method for completing both phases simultaneously. The proposed method is based on a prediction model for bottom-level time series and uses a structured regularization term to incorporate upper-level forecasts into the prediction model. We also develop a backpropagation algorithm specialized for applying our method to artificial neural networks for time series prediction. Experimental results using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency to other methods for time series prediction.

A number of reconciliation approaches have been proposed, from both game-theoretical and statistical points of view. However, most of these approaches make unrealistic unbiasedness assumptions and overlook the fact that the underlying stochastic processes may be nonstationary. We propose here an alternative approach to the forecast reconciliation problem in a constrained regression framework. This relies on a multivariate least squares estimator, with equality constraints on the coefficients (denoted MLSE). A recursive and adaptive version of that estimator is derived (denoted MRLSE), hence allowing to track the optimal reconciliation in a fully data-driven manner.

            "    ('abstract', 'Hierarchical load forecasting (HLF) is an approach to generate forecasts for hierarchical loadtime series. The performance of HLF can be improved by optimizing the forecasting model and the hierarchical structure. Previous studies mostly focus on the forecasting model while the hierarchical structure is usually formed by clustering of natural attributes like geography, customer type, or the similarities between load profiles. A major limitation of these natural hierarchical structures is the mismatched objectives between clustering and forecasting. Clustering aims to minimize the dissimilarity among customers of a group while forecasting aims to minimize their forecasting errors.The two independent optimizations could limit the overall forecasting performance. Hence, this paper attempts to integrate the hierarchical structure and the forecasting model by a novel closed-loopclustering (CLC) algorithm. It links the objectives of forecasting and clustering by a feedback mechanism to return the goodness-of-fit as the criterion for the clustering. In this way, the hierarchical structure is enhanced by re-assigning the cluster membership and the parameters of the forecasting models are updated iteratively. The method is comparatively assessed with existing HLF methods. Using the same forecasting model, the proposed hierarchical structure outperforms the bottom-up structure by 52.20{\\\\%}, ensemble-based structure by 26.89{\\\\%}, load-profile structures by 19.90{\\\\%}, respectively. {\\\\copyright} 2020 IEEE.'), \n",

The reasoning behind this approach is to estimate robust bottom-level models that can deal with the intrinsic noise present at this level due to the lack of information. Two variants are presented: First, we solve a single optimization problem that constructs all the related regression functions together, relating the bottom level series with the root node, while the second variant pools relates the leaf nodes with their respective parent nodes.

The hierarchical approach is applied to decompose the problem into sub-problems at low-level regions, which are resolved through standard probabilistic models such as gradient boosted regression trees, quantile regression forests and quantile regression neural networks, coupled with principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the sub-problems. The hierarchical perspective is then finalized to forecast the aggregate load at a high-level geographic region through an ensemble methodology based on a penalized linear quantile regression model. This paper brings, as relevant contributions, the development of hierarchical probabilistic forecasting framework, its comparison with non-hierarchical frameworks, and the assessment of the role of data dimensionality refduction.

These systems, sometimes referred to as constrained or hierarchical forecasting (HF), are based upon a user defined strategy for aggregating items into families. HF systems are for determining forecasts for items and their respective families following either a direct strategy, which utilizes the contemporaneous demand values to compute a forecast, or a derived strategy, which determines forecasts for items by proportioning a parent family forecast. The objectives of HF systems include improved forecast performance and a reduction in the overall forecasting burden. HF strategies rely upon the premise that forecasts for families of items are more accurate than forecasts for individual items. Research literature indicates that HF system forecast performance is dependent upon the statistical nature of the items comprising the aggregated family. This literature further suggests that families be formed such that important information (demand patterns) exhibited within the item-level time series' does not get lost when summing these series to define the aggregated group time series. Therefore, families of HF systems would logically be defined to provide a high degree of homogeneity, or positive correlation among family members. This strategy suggests that a group of homogenous items will tend to result in an aggregate time series which exhibits (or at least does not obscure) data patterns present in time series of the component items comprising the family. This study is an examination of strategies and guidelines for specifying aggregated families within HF systems. In particular, simulation is used as the vehicle to measure forecast performance at the aggregate (family) level. Varying degrees of systematically controlled, statistical correlation between subaggregate (item) time series comprising the forecast families is investigated using all four combinations of two forecast smoothing techniques and two forecast strategies. The results of this study support the research literature conclusion that higher positive correlation does indeed lead to improved forecast performance at the aggregate level. However, the results also indicate that higher negative correlation also leads to improved forecast performance at the aggregate level. An additional observation suggests that direct forecasts of an aggregate variable are more accurate than derived forecasts. Scope and purpose Many firms rely upon demand forecasts to conduct short-term planning activities such as purchasing, production planning and inventory control. These forecasts are often generated weekly. Firms that maintain a large product line consisting of thousands of items are faced with an especially burdensome forecast task. Consequently, firms such as IBM and American Software, Inc. offer software packages capable of forecasting demand for families of items. Family-based forecast systems attempt to improve forecast performance while offering a reduction in the overall forecasting burden. This study is an examination of strategies for specifying families within large forecast systems.

A key challenge of multi-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures across sub-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the state-level forecasts are coherent with the national-level forecasts.

However, they still display some limitations, being mainly subject to the forecasting methods used for generating the base forecasts and the particularities of the examined series. This paper deals with such limitations by considering three different strategies: (i) combining forecasts of multiple methods, (ii) applying bias adjustments and (iii) selectively implementing temporal hierarchies to avoid seasonal shrinkage. The proposed strategies can be applied either separately or simultaneously, being complements to the method considered for reconciling the base forecasts and completely independent from each other. Their effect is evaluated using the monthly series of the M and M3 competitions. The results are very promising, displaying lots of potential for improving the performance of temporal hierarchies, both in terms of accuracy and bias. {\\\\copyright} 2019 Spiliotis et al.

Optimal decision-making requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities, and regions. The forecasts should be coherent in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential, since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the appropriate amount being provided from the previous level. We introduce a new probabilistic forecasting method for a large hierarchy based on UK residential smart meter data. We find our method provides coherent and accurate probabilistic forecasts, as a result of an effective forecast combination. Furthermore, by avoiding distributional assumptions, we find that our method captures the variety of distributions in the smart meter hierarchy. Finally, the results confirm that, to ensure coherency in our large-scale hierarchy, it is sufficient to model a set of lower-dimension dependencies, rather than modeling the entire joint distribution of all series in the hierarchy. In achieving coherent and accurate hierarchical probabilistic forecasts, this work contributes to improved decision-making for smart grids.

Combining forecasts from multiple temporal aggregation levels exploits information differences and mitigates model uncertainty, while reconciliation ensures a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different horizons. In previous studies, weights assigned to the forecasts were given by the structure of the hierarchy or the forecast error variances without considering potential autocorrelation in the forecast errors. Our first estimator considers the autocovariance matrix within each aggregation level. Since this can be difficult to estimate, we propose a second estimator that blends autocorrelation and variance information, but only requires estimation of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient at each aggregation level. Our third and fourth estimators facilitate information sharing between aggregation levels using robust estimates of the cross-correlation matrix and its inverse. We compare the proposed estimators in a simulation study and demonstrate their usefulness through an application to short-term electricity load forecasting in four price areas in Sweden. We find that by taking account of auto- and cross-covariances when reconciling forecasts, accuracy can be significantly improved uniformly across all frequencies and areas. {\\\\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.'), \n",

However, when dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting model, forecasters have also to select a suitable method for reconciling the base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent. Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting reconciliation method and leading to more accurate coherent forecasts. The approach, which we call conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on machine learning classification methods that use time series features to select the reconciliation method for each hierarchy. Moreover, it allows the selection to be tailored according to the accuracy measure of preference and the hierarchical level(s) of interest. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting can lead to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels. {\\\\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.'), \n",

The data and forecasts are organized in a hierarchy based on disaggregating the data according to the division and subdistrict levels (geographical regions). Following Athanasopoulos, Ahmed, and Hyndman, we consider five approaches to hierarchical forecasting; two variations of the top-down approach; the bottom-up method; top-down approach where top-level forecasts are disaggregated according to the forecasted proportions of the lower level series; and the new optimal combination approach introduced by Hyndman, Ahmed, Athanasopoulos, and Shang. The forecasts are obtained from these five approaches using two well-known methods; Exponential Smoothing (ES) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The forecasts are then compared across the two methods and across the various approaches by using various out-of-sample forecast evaluations. The forecast performance evaluation shows that in most cases either the top-down or the bottom-up approach performs best while the optimal combination method approach is the second best for the major crops production hierarchies we consider. By applying these methods, we produce detailed forecasts of the production of major crops in Pakistan for all levels of hierarchies and draw some useful conclusions for policy makers. {\\\\copyright} 2017 Taylor {\\\\&} Francis Group, LLC.'), \n",

Effectively, there are several applications where time series can be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical structure using attributes such as geographical location, product type, etc. Power networks face interesting problems related to its transition to computer-aided grids. Data can be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical structure, and there is the possibility to look for both single and aggregated points along the grid. Along this work, we applied different hierarchical forecasting methods to them. Three different approaches are compared, two common approaches, bottom-up approach, top-down approach and another one based on the hierarchical structure of data, the optimal regression combination. The evaluation considers short-term forecasting (24-h ahead). Additionally,we discussed the importance associated to the correlation degree among series to improve forecasting accuracy. Our results demonstrated that the hierarchical approach outperforms bottom-up approach at intermediate/high levels. At lower levels, it presents a superior performance in less homogeneous substations, i. e. for the substations linked to different type of customers. Additionally, its performance is comparable to the top-down approach at top levels. This approach revealed to be an interesting tool for hierarchical data analysis. It allows to achieve a good performance at top levels as the top-down approach and at same time it allows to capture series dynamics at bottom levels as the bottom-up. {\\\\copyright} Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.'), \n",
